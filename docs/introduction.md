# Introduction

- Moore's law unsustainable
- further increasing processor frequency / shrinking transistor sizes inefficient or not possible
- $\rightarrow$ more efficient to have multiple processors

## Parallel Computing

- concurrent vs parallel
  - concurrency: illusion of parallelism via scheduling of tasks
- distributed vs shared Memory
- we only look at shared memory
